# Mixed Messages

## Overview
This is the first official Portfolio Project I have completed as part of the CodeCademy Full Stack Pathway.
The aim was to build a message generator program.
Every time the program is run, there should be a new, randomized output - which was required to consist of at least three pieces of data. 
Suggested examples included:
- an astrology generator
- inspirational messages
- nonsensical jokes.
